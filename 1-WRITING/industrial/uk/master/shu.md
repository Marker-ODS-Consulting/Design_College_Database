> All applicants are expected to show us a portfolio of creative work which helps us to assess their creative and visual thinking. You normally bring the portfolio to your interview. If you are applying from another country and unable to travel to interview in the UK send us a PDF version of your portfolio or a link to your online folio.  

>	Your portfolio should contain examples of design work and any other creative work which may be relevant to your application. We will be looking for evidence of professional knowledge and skills, good written and visual communication and, especially, good creative thinking evident through examples showing your design process. All work in the portfolio should have clear descriptive text saying what the images show, what was the project brief/context for the work and what were the main points you aimed to address in the work. You should also indicate when and in what circumstances the work was done for example BA, professional practice etc. Your portfolio may be reviewed in your absence so make sure your text and images tell us the project stories so we can clearly understand it.  

>	We are interested to see examples of the development process that went into your work, as well as the final outcome, we will also be looking at the level of organisation and communication skill which went into preparation of the portfolio.

##### 硬性要求解读：
- 提交PDF格式的作品集，或者提交URL形式的作品集（推荐 Dropbox 链接）

##### 软性要求解读：

整体来说谢菲尔德哈勒姆对于作品集的要求非常宽泛，他们希望能够看到一个完整的能体现设计思维和设计方法的作品集，这基本上也是我们对作品集控制的底线。不需要什么特别的准备，把完整版作品集提交上去即可。
