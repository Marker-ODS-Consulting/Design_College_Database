**2分钟视频要求(Design Product challenge)原文：**   



>Please select one of the Design Products challenges below and take no more than 1 hour to creatively respond to it, producing a series of design proposals, present these in your 2 minute video.
Instructions:
> - In your two-minute film please clearly state which challenge you selected and describe the approach you took.
> - We expect a minimum of 3 ‘sketched or storyboarded concepts’ that you can guide us through.
> - Pay specific attention to the way your proposals could interact with; their environment, intended users/stakeholders, existing systems, materials and technologies.
> - Please conclude with a section on which of these proposals you would be most passionate about taking forward and what you would do next; Who would you want to work with? What would you do? How would you make design decisions? How does this relate to your current practice and future ambitions?

> - A) Smart Technologies.Propose a ‘smart’ technology application/device that has an environmental or socially led objective. Where does the device/application live? What does it enable? What data does it rely upon? How do people engage with it? What are its implications on future economies or how we live and work together?
</BR>
> - B) Domestic Life in the Circular Economy.Imagine that in 2035 recycling, reuse and repair are commonplace with the majority of products designed to allow for the effective recovery of valuable components and materials. In this future circular economy individuals are sustainably conscious and their homes reflect their value. Describe proposals that could address circular economy and promote sustainability for the home environment?
> - C)  Design for human behaviour. The design of spaces, systems and artefacts informs our behaviour and responses to the surrounding world. Simple interactions, provocations and interruptions can dramatically change our mood, our perspective and our relationships with others. Please describe creative responses where you could intervene for a positive or negative change and describe the nature of how you would intervene.

### 2. 翻译与解读：

##### 作品集要求解读：
- 作品集无硬性要求, 5个项目左右即可。提交系统中每个项目一个PDF文件，同时提供每个项目的说明，200-300字



##### 视频部分要求解读

这其实是RCA 2019年的面试题，这个视频要求也只能在申请系统中看到。要求需要设计师完成3个选题中的一个，并完成设计，形成3个设计方案的表现，通过手绘或故事版。并以视频的形式呈现。

其实这里官方的说明文档出现了明显的乌龙(至少2020年秋季申请这一批)，即学校放出了视频的要求和主题，但并没有删掉1小时内完成这个要求。1小时内完成，其实是2019年和之前，皇艺面试时，会提前1小时给你题目，然后1小时后迅速展开面试的一种做法，现在改成了主动提交视频但并没有删掉“1小时内”。并不清楚为什么皇艺会出现这样的错误。

具体做出什么设计并不重要，如何能够呈现出设计过程中的思维方式更加重要。


一些建议：

  - 真人出镜并说话录制，avi/mp4/mov/wmv 格式，最长2分钟
  - 不要fancy，而要逻辑
  - 自己出镜、自己说话
