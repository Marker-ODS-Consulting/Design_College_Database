> #### Portfolio advice

> - Your portfolio should demonstrate creative development, whether for a college project or in your personal work. By creative development, we mean ideas that have originated through your own experience and research and progressed towards potential visual proposals. Ideas, visual research and experimentation are more important than finished design solutions and can be shown in 2D work, or through photos of 3D objects and maquettes.  
> - It is important that the creative work you include reflects and demonstrates your thinking, initiative and personal commitment to a particular project, theme or idea.  We are interested in you as an individual, your personal interests, your creativity and initiative in finding out about your proposed area of study. We would also like to know about your favourite designers and artists, where you have seen their work at first hand and how you have acquired more information about the work that interests you.



> #### Interview
> The interviews are used to evaluate the extent to which a candidate demonstrates:
> - The suitability, appropriateness and deliverability of the Project Proposal in relation to the professional expertise of the staff team
> - Analytical and critical skills and the ability of the applicant to apply these to the Project Proposal
> - The quality of the design work submitted in support of the application and the 'match' between this and the Project Proposal
> - The applicant's awareness of the historical, cultural and social implications of their project
> - The resource implications of the Project Proposal and the ability of the course and the applicant to support the practical realisation of the project. All applications are reviewed by at least two of the course team.

### 2. 翻译与解读：

##### 作品集硬性要求：
- 30 页
- 至少一个完整的项目  
- 可以提交视频

##### 作品集软性要求：

- 中央圣马丁一向对于作品集要求比较宽松，只需要满足30页的要求就可以了。  
- 建议：学生至少需要在基础传统工业设计思维方式和表现技法的基础上，能够表现出一定的对于设计批评或设计思辨的体现，这些内容比较符合艺术类学校的胃口。


##### 面试  

学校会在提交申请的学生中选择一部分学生邀请进入面试环节，中国学生基本上都是在线面试。面试时候注意能够传达出一个完整的人物设定，你的过往项目、设计思维和你未来的学习计划大致能够产生一种一致性即可。
