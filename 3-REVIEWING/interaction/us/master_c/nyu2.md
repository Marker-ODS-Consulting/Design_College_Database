> - Submission of a creative portfolio is optional due to the diversity of applicant backgrounds. Portfolio materials need not be professional-quality work or even interactive media projects. Applicants are encouraged to submit work that is reflective of their interests and experiences. If you come from a creative background or enjoy making things, we encourage you to submit your work, as this will give us a better overall impression of you and your interests.
> - If you wish to send a portfolio, please prepare the following: We ask that applicants limit the creative work to just one of the following formats:
> - URL. Please check very carefully that all links are working properly. Please include the URL with your online application.
> - Link to a shared Google Drive folder of your work
Print. Laser copies, photograph prints, portfolio book. Do not exceed 11″ x 14″ dimensions.
> - Writing Samples. Limit: No more than 20 pages.
> - Description of your portfolio. If you are submitting a hardcopy portfolio, it is important that you include a printed version of instructions for viewing the portfolio, a list of contents with a short description of each piece, and your role in the production of the content. Portfolios that do not have a clear set of instructions will not be reviewed. If you submit a URL, you can either include the description/instructions in the email or in the website directly.
> - A self-addressed, stamped envelope (if you want your creative materials returned).
> - Do not send an original copy of your creative work. ITP cannot be held responsible for any materials lost or damaged while in our possession or in transit.
