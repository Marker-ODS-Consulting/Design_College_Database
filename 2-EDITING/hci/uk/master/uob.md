**专业描述：**   

> You will have the opportunity to broaden your studies on our Human Computer Interaction Masters/MSc through an optional module in areas such as Robotics. The course builds upon the world-class research of the HCI Centre through project work and is designed to prepare you for a career in research or in industry or commerce.

> The discipline of Human Computer Interaction is about many things: It is about the interface that a system provides (and, therefore, is the most important and most complex component of most systems) but it is also about so much more. We need to understand the people that use the systems and their abilities and constraints. We need to understand how to build systems that really work and also how to evaluate them. We also need to be able to think creatively in order to build innovative solutions to new problems and emerging applications and domains - to be able to solve the problems of tomorrow’s world rather than just those of today.

> This course covers the underpinning theories, methodologies and practices of HCI. It includes specialist modules in application domains. Through course and project work your degree is intimately integrated into the research of the University’s HCI centre.

### 2. 翻译与解读：
Human Computer Interaction Masters / MSc
##### 硬性要求提取：
- 作品集无硬性要求，如果学生准备提交作品集，一般准备3-5个项目即可。HCI是一门研究系统与用户之间的交互关系的学问，人机交互界面通常是指用户可见的部分。用户通过人机交互界面与系统交流，并进行操作。学生在准备作品集内容的过程中，可以从HCI的定义出发，着重对用户行为和心理的研究。  

##### 课程设置解读：
- 伯明翰大学教学目标包括能够创造性思考，这是为了构建创新解决新问题的方法和新兴应用领域;这一发展才能带动未来人机交互的发展而不仅仅是致力于解决当下的技术问题。

- 伯明翰大学人机交互的学科涉及很多方面，学生需要了解使用系统的人员及其能力和约束，了解如何构建真正有效的系统以及如何评估它们，还需要能够创造性地思考，以便为新问题和新兴应用程序和领域构建创新解决方案，以便能够解决未来世界的问题而不仅仅是今天的问题。
