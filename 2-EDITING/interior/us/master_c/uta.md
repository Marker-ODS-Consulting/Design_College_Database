The portfolio is not expected to show interior design skills. Rather, it should contain work that demonstrates facility with a variety of media and illustrates three-dimensional understanding. You may demonstrate your creative, artistic, and perceptual skills through painting, sculpture, or other three-dimensional explorations, such as objects you have designed and/or constructed. Photography as an example of creative work must demonstrate intention in composition, color/light, or other critical point of view.

### 2. 翻译与解读：

##### 硬性要求解读：
- 作品集的版面一定要适合屏幕阅读
- 文件大小不超过25mb



##### 软性要求解读：
在内容上，学校特意指出了不一定非要展示出过多的关于室内设计的技法，而应该更多的体现对三维空间的理解。这里的室内设计的技法指表现技法，也就是说你不用过多考虑好看与否，更应该注重宏观角度的东西，以及创意思维方面的东西。
