### 2. 翻译与解读：

##### 硬性要求解读：
- 提交PDF文档
- 页面尺寸为A4横版
- 个人简历和个人陈述要放在作品集文件内

##### 软性要求解读：
作品集的内容学校给出了大概方向。首先是项目要是你最近的项目，以及你最好的项目。那么这个最近的项目我们一般控制在两年内。其次，就是项目内容的多样性与丰富性。比如：项目类型上不仅可以是建筑设计，也可以是批判设计，艺术，研究等等。同时，尺度上也可以有不同的变化，小到家具，大到城市规划设计等等。另外就是不同的手法，例如手绘，电脑制图，模型制作，装置等等。总的来说就是作品集内容看起来不要过于单一，而是要全方位的，不同维度和角度的展现你的能力。
