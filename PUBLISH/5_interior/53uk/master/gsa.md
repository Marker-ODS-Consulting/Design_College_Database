> How to demonstrate your individual interests, approach and creativity  
> - We are very keen to learn about your interest in design; this includes historical or contemporary artists / designers that you are inspired
by, exhibitions you have visited, and work experience you have undertaken. We want to know what or who has inspired you within your
design specialism and motivated you to make an application to a specialist programme at GSA.
> - You may include work generated from previous study and independently generated work either self-directed or produced within
industry. If there is work included that you have professionally designed for clients or that was undertaken as part of a group project,
please ensure your role within the project is explicit.
>
> How to show your research methods, and the links between your research and the development of ideas  
> - We are interested in how and where you gather the research that informs your projects and how you analyse this information. We want to know about how this research informs the concepts and ideas behind your work and how the progress and develop; from the initial starting point through to a finished piece of work.
> - This could be evidenced by uploading high quality scans of work in progress sketchbook pages, notebooks or loose sheets. This should be mainly made up of your own work, we do not want to see lots of secondary source material (magazine cut outs, print outs from the
internet, photocopies of books).  
> - Where the portfolio requires it, you may include short text descriptions for the work you are presenting.
>
> How to evidence your working process, and your technical knowledge and skills
>  In order to show your working process and technical abilities during the development of your projects, you may wish to combine several pieces of work together onto one page. You could do this by photographing or scanning sketch books, working sheets, technical log books, prototypes, experiments, resolved 3d work individually and use Photoshop (or a similar programme) to combine into one page.
When recording your work in this way make sure the imagery is of high quality and an appropriate size to ensure that the details that you wish to communicate can be read by the academic staff viewing it.
>
> How to show fully resolved work and your understanding of it’s professional context
>  We are interested in how you visually present and communicate about your work. It is important to show that you understand how and where to position your work within your design specialism. This could be evidenced by including high quality photographs of fully resolved outcomes indicating its context (position in market). Including relevant contemporary sources within the research would also demonstrate the setting for your resolved outcomes.  
Approximately 20% of the imagery in your digital portfolio should include final outcomes. The remaining 80% should focus onyour design process and the elements listed on the previous 4 slides.
>
> - a single PDF file, consisting of approximately 20 pages (please note portfolios that are longer may not be fully read).  
> - or 20 individual images.  
> - Your digital portfolio should consist of a minimum of 3 projects.

### 2. 翻译与解读：

##### 硬性要求提取：
- 作品集大约保持在最多20页，如果你做的超出20页的范围，超出的内容就很可能看不到了(学校大约有10分钟时间去浏览)。所以这里还是建议大家把作品集页数控制在20页内。那么具体方法，可以使用A3的页面，或者两个A4横版（594mm x 210mm）拼成的页面去做。  
- 项目最少3个。这里建议一般至少放4个，20页的话，放5个大部分情况下也是可以的。  


##### 软性要求解读：
作品集方面没有明确的硬性要求。从作品集内容风格来说，没有伦艺那么的偏向艺术，相对比较落地的感觉。从之前学生的反馈来看，GSA在研究生的教学项目上都是非常抽象概念的项目，几乎没有落地的实际项目。但是从作品集申请的结果来看，较为实际落地的项目也是被接受的。所以你的作品内容上，可以有一些比较落地的解决实际问题的项目，或者是比较有社会意义的项目，同时在包含一些比较偏向概念，创意性的项目。
