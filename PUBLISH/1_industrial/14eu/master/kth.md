> Please upload the portfolio as a PDF along with the rest of your supporting documents.
>
> The portfolio is an opportunity for you to prove your capability in Industrial Design and to present the more visual qualities of your work. For example you can show;
>
 > -   your formgiving process where you try out and evaluate different designs/styling of your product or service
 > -   hand sketches and other visualizations including rendered CAD geometries
 > -   how you have involved users in your design process through user studies or other design methods
 > -   how ergonomics have informed your design process
>
>
>A portfolio should preferably be in landscape format, but if you already have one in portrait format you can use that as well. We expect to see a lot of images and sketches but you must also be sure to describe in text the projects or items you present. Please use a clear title to the project (Like “New Electric Lawnmower for Shared Use”) and write a short description of the project. You can also highlight features in your design that are key to your concept. The time you spent on the project, the number of students involved and what your own contribution was are all examples of additional information we find very useful.
>
>The volume of the design portfolio is not restricted, however we recommend that you limit it to the 3-5 design projects you have worked with that you consider most relevant to our program.

### 2. 翻译与解读：

##### 硬性要求解读：
- PDF 格式
- 推荐 3-5 个项目（严格说不限制个数）



##### 软性要求解读：
- 相比于查尔姆斯，KTH对作品集的要求非常宽泛，如学校说：推荐横版但是如果你已经做了竖版也行，推荐3-5个项目但你多点少的也可以。所以，对应KTH只需要提交我们最完整的基础稿作品集就行。
